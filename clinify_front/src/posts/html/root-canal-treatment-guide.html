        Root canal treatment, often misunderstood and feared, is a highly effective dental procedure that saves millions of teeth each year. Thanks to advancements in dental technology, modern root canal treatments are painless, efficient, and long-lasting. In this guide, we’ll explore the essentials of root canal therapy, its benefits, and why Montenegro is becoming a leading destination for this procedure.
      </p>

      <h2>1. What Is Root Canal Treatment?</h2>
      <p>
        A root canal, or endodontic therapy, addresses the inner structure of a tooth. It involves removing infected or damaged pulp tissue, cleaning and disinfecting the root canals, and sealing them to prevent further issues. This procedure preserves the tooth’s natural structure while eliminating pain and infection.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Why Is a Root Canal Necessary?</h2>
      <p>
        When the pulp inside a tooth becomes inflamed or infected, it can cause severe pain and lead to abscesses or bone loss if untreated. Root canals are essential to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Save the Natural Tooth:</strong> Prevents extraction and the need for costly replacements.</li>
        <li><strong>Eliminate Pain:</strong> Resolves sensitivity and discomfort caused by infection.</li>
        <li><strong>Stop Infection Spread:</strong> Protects surrounding teeth and tissues from further complications.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Common Signs You May Need a Root Canal</h2>
      <p>
        Knowing the warning signs can help you seek timely treatment:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Severe toothache that intensifies when chewing or applying pressure</li>
        <li>Prolonged sensitivity to hot or cold temperatures</li>
        <li>Dark discoloration of the tooth</li>
        <li>Swelling or tenderness in the gums near the affected tooth</li>
        <li>Recurring abscesses or pimple-like bumps on the gums</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. The Root Canal Procedure: Step-by-Step</h2>

        Here’s what you can expect during a root canal treatment:
      </p>

        <li><strong>Anesthesia:</strong> Local anesthesia ensures a pain-free experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Pulp Removal:</strong> The infected pulp is carefully removed, and the canals are cleaned and shaped.</li>
        <li><strong>Filling:</strong> A biocompatible material, such as gutta-percha, is used to fill and seal the canals.</li>
        <li><strong>Restoration:</strong> A crown or filling is placed over the tooth to restore its functionality and protect it from future damage.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>5. Post-Treatment Care and Recovery</h2>
