      <h2>2. Key Benefits of Orthodontic Care</h2>

        Beyond cosmetic improvements, orthodontic treatments offer numerous health benefits:

        <li><strong>Enhanced Confidence:</strong> A well-aligned smile boosts self-esteem and social interactions.</li>

        <li><strong>Traditional Metal Braces:</strong> Highly effective for complex cases, using metal brackets and wires.</li>
        <li><strong>Ceramic Braces:</strong> Similar to metal braces but less noticeable, thanks to tooth-colored brackets.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear Aligners:</strong> Popular options like Invisalign offer removable, nearly invisible trays for a discreet experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Lingual Braces:</strong> Custom braces placed behind the teeth for complete invisibility.</li>
