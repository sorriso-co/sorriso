        As dental care costs continue to soar in the United States, more Americans are seeking alternatives abroad. Major dental procedures, including dental implants, full-mouth rehabilitations, and cosmetic makeovers, can often be prohibitively expensive. Montenegro has emerged as a leading destination for Americans, offering world-class dental care at a fraction of the cost, combined with the charm of a stunning European getaway. This guide will explain why Montenegro is the ultimate choice for your dental treatment.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Significant Cost Savings</h2>

      <p>
        In Montenegro, these procedures are available at a fraction of the cost. A single dental implant typically costs around $800 to $1,000, while full-mouth rehabilitations and cosmetic treatments are 50–70% cheaper. These savings make high-quality dental care accessible without compromising on outcomes.
