      <h2>1. Research Your Destination and Clinic</h2>
      <p>
        The foundation of a successful dental tourism experience is thorough research. Begin by selecting a reputable destination known for its advanced dental care. Montenegro has earned a strong reputation for its modern clinics, skilled professionals, and adherence to international standards.

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Travel:</strong> Flights, local transportation, and airport transfers</li>
        <li><strong>Accommodation:</strong> Hotels or short-term rentals near your chosen clinic</li>
        <li><strong>Treatment Costs:</strong> Dental procedure fees, including potential add-ons</li>
        <li><strong>Leisure:</strong> Sightseeing, meals, and activities</li>
