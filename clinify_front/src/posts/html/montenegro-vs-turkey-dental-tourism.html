      <p>
        Turkey has long been a favorite for dental tourists, renowned for its affordable treatments and luxurious packages. However, Montenegro is rapidly becoming a top contender, offering exceptional value, personalized care, and a serene environment. This comparison will help you understand why Montenegro is the superior choice for dental tourism.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Turkey’s Dental Tourism Appeal</h2>
      <p>
        Turkey has built a solid reputation as a dental tourism hub, particularly in cities like Istanbul and Antalya. Patients are drawn to its modern clinics, competitive prices, and convenient packages that include accommodations and transportation. However, the sheer volume of patients in Turkish clinics often leads to rushed procedures and limited post-treatment care.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Montenegro: A Rising Star in Dental Tourism</h2>
      <p>
        Montenegro offers a refreshing alternative with its unique blend of affordability, quality, and tranquility. Here’s what sets Montenegro apart:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lower Prices:</strong> Treatments in Montenegro are 15-20% cheaper than in Turkey.</li>
        <li><strong>High Standards:</strong> Clinics use premium materials and adhere to strict EU quality and safety regulations.</li>
        <li><strong>Personalized Care:</strong> Smaller clinics mean more time and attention dedicated to each patient.</li>
        <li><strong>Peaceful Environment:</strong> Montenegro’s pristine landscapes and slower pace offer a perfect recovery setting.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Cost Comparison: Montenegro vs. Turkey</h2>

          </tr>
        </thead>

      </table>

      <h2>4. Quality of Care and Attention</h2>

        <li>Detailed aftercare plans for long-term success</li>
        <li>No overcrowded clinics, ensuring thorough and unrushed treatments</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Travel and Recovery Experience</h2>
      <p>
        Montenegro is a hidden gem, offering an unparalleled recovery environment:
      </p>
