      <p>
        Dental tourism has become a popular option for patients seeking high-quality, affordable dental care abroad. While Hungary and Croatia have traditionally been top choices, Montenegro is rapidly emerging as the new leader in dental tourism. Offering competitive prices, cutting-edge clinics, and stunning natural surroundings, Montenegro provides a unique and superior experience. Here’s a comprehensive comparison to help you decide.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Dental Tourism in Hungary</h2>
      <p>
        Hungary has long been a pioneer in dental tourism, particularly in Budapest, known as the “Dental Capital of Europe.” Patients from Western Europe and beyond are drawn by its established reputation for quality care and reasonable prices. However, increasing demand has driven up costs, and many clinics now face longer waiting times.
      </p>
      <p>
        While Hungary still offers modern facilities and skilled professionals, it’s no longer the most budget-friendly option for dental care.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Dental Tourism in Croatia</h2>
      <p>
        Croatia’s coastal charm and modern dental clinics have made it a strong contender in the dental tourism market. Cities like Zagreb and Split offer professional services and picturesque settings. However, rising operational costs have led to higher treatment prices, narrowing the cost advantage that once set Croatia apart.
